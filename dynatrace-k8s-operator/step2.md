# Prepare Dynatrace tokens for OneAgent Operator

OneAgent Operator requires two different tokens for interacting with Dynatrace servers. These two tokens are made available to OneAgent Operator by means of a Kubernetes secret as explained at a later step.

Within your tenant go to:

[API Token](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/reference/dynatrace-concepts/what-is-an-access-token/):

create API token and place in editor for later reference
